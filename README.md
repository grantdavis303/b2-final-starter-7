- [] Complete All User Stories
- [] Students use the principles of MVC to effectively organize code with only 1 - 2 infractions. Routes and Actions mostly follow RESTful conventions
- [] ActiveRecord helpers are utilized most of the time. More complex ActiveRecord (joining, grouping, aggregating) is used to process data at least once. Queries are functional and accurate.
- [] 100% coverage for models. 
- [] 98% coverage for features. Tests are well written and meaningful. All tests passing. TDD Process is clear throughout commits. Some effective sad path and edge case testing. Tests utilize within blocks to target specific areas of a page.
